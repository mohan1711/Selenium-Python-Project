XPATH:

1. xpath is defined as xml path.
2. xpath is a syntax or a language used to find any element in any web page using the xml path expression.
3. xpath is used to find the location of any web element in a web page using HTML DOM structure.
4. xpath can be used to navigate through elements and attributes in DOM(Document object model).
5. xpath is an address of an element.
6. xpath 100% finds any element even in any complex websites.

Types:
1. Absolute or Full xpath.      /html/body/div/div[1]/div/div[1]/div/div[2]/div[2]/form/div[3]/button
*** Navigates from to route node of HTML and comes down one by one into nodes an find our element.
** It always starts with /
* We use only tags or nodes


2. Relative or Partial xpath. Syntax:
Syntax: //tagname[@attribute='value']
Example: //button[@name='Login']
*** Here is directly jump to the element in the DOM.
** It starts with //
* We use attributes.

******* HOW TO WRITE XPATHS MANUALLY


******* Two reasons to prefer relative x path
1. R xpath is more stable than A xpath. If developer introduces new features, then absolute xpath is broken.
2. Also the A xpath is very lengthier and looks odd.


Methods used along with xpath.

1. and  SYNTAX: //input[@id='username' and @name='username_data'] - if both data matches the xpath will be found

2. or   SYNTAX: //input[@id='pass' or @name='password'] - if any one value is matching then xpath will be found.

3. text() - can be used to find the element based on the inner text. SYNTAX: //a[text()='male']

4. contains() -  some pages are dynamic were some values keeps changing,
ex: if "id" starts with password and changes to passcode dynamically. Then contains with can be used to find the
element whose value can be anywhere in the value. SYNTAX: //*[contains(@id,'ss')]

5. starts-with() - some pages are dynamic were some values keeps changing,
ex: if "id" starts with start and changes to stop dynamically. Then starts with can be used to find the
element whose value starts with 'st'. SYNTAX: //*[starts-with(@id,'st')]
